Tutorials
---------

The following tutorials contain the workflow and code to simulate and visualize commonly
studied M/EEG signals including event related potentials and low frequency rhythms in
the alpha, beta and gamma bands. These tutorial workflows are analogous to those on the
`textbook website <https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/textbook/content/preface.html>`_.

We strongly recommend that you first go through the background information provided on
the `HNN textbook website
<https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/textbook/content/preface.html>`_ and each of the
HNN GUI tutorials, after which the code and instructions in these HNN-core tutorials
will be clearer.  All tutorials build from our prior publications investigating the
origin of ERPs and brain rhythms in the somatosensory system, and parameter and data
sets are provided to help users get started.
