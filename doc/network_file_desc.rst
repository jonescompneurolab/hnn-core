Network File Content
====================

File Content Description
------------------------
hdf5 is the file format used for storing the Network object. The network is stored in a layered format. The first layer consists of the network attributes.
The attributes of the network are then broken down until the network can be represented as a collection of key value pairs. For example - cell_types is a network
attribute therefore in the first layer. The description of each cell type is in layer 2. Each cell has various sections. The description of a section is in layer 3.
Below are the attributes of the network.
