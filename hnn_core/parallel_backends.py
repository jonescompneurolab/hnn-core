            #    A. Hardware-Threading: The number of logical and physical
            #    cores reported are always equal to each other. It is not clear
            #    to me if you can enable true hardware-threading on OSCAR, nor
            #    if you can even detect it. The closest that OSCAR has to
            #    documentation about requesting multiple threads is here:
            #    https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/submitting-jobs/
            #    mpi-jobs#hybrid-mpiopenmp
            #    which discusses using `--cpus-per-task` and then setting a
            #    custom OpenMP environment variable. (Note that OpenMP is a
            #    very, very different technology than OpenMPI!) Similarly, I
            #    cannot get a successful allocation using the option
            #    `--threads-per-core` (see
            #    https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html ) when using any value
            #    except one. Fortunately, since the logical CPU number appears
            #    to always match the physical number, OSCAR should always fail
            #    our hardware-threading detection "test".
            #

            #    node as a whole, which you do NOT necessarily have access to,
            #    depending on your allocation. For a single node, the number of
