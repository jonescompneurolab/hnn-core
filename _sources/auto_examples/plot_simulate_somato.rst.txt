First, we will import the packages and define the paths


.. code-block:: default

    import os.path as op
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    import mne
    from mne.datasets import somato
    from mne.minimum_norm import apply_inverse, make_inverse_operator

    data_path = somato.data_path()
    subject = '01'
    task = 'somato'
    raw_fname = op.join(data_path, 'sub-{}'.format(subject), 'meg',
                        'sub-{}_task-{}_meg.fif'.format(subject, task))
    fwd_fname = op.join(data_path, 'derivatives', 'sub-{}'.format(subject),
                        'sub-{}_task-{}-fwd.fif'.format(subject, task))
    subjects_dir = op.join(data_path, 'derivatives', 'freesurfer', 'subjects')
