# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Demonstrating patience toward all contributors and developers
    * Please keep in mind that almost everyone who works on HNN is a researcher (e.g. a graduate student, post-doc, professor, etc.) who has **many** time-intensive obligations in addition to HNN. Almost everyone working on HNN is volunteering their time, including most of the development team.
    * We will do our best to provide an initial response to any contribution submissions ASAP, preferably within a week of submission.
* Keeping all communications public where possible, including only communicating on Github Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Privately emailing contributors or developers in an effort to get a faster response
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at hnneurosolver@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

For those interested in becoming GSoC Contributors: please do not reach out to us privately, but instead make your initial contact via the [INCF GSoC recommendations here](https://www.incf.org/recommendations-gsoc-contributors). We will reach out if and when we are able. 

Every year, we receive significantly more GSoC interest than we are able to support (approximately two projects). Some good guidance on common expectations and tips for improving your chances in general are available [here at the Jenkins project's GSoC information page](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/contributors/).

## AI and LLM Policy

We do allow AI- and LLM- based code and documentation contributions. However, *the contributor is responsible for every line of code and text submitted* as part of their contributions. We reserve the right to close or ignore any contributions which may have been colloquially "vibe-coded", meaning the contributor does not fully understand the code or text changes themself, or there is a strong mismatch between a contribution's documentation versus its code changes, or the contributions exhibit other signs of having been submitted without the contributor fully understanding or double-checking the contents. Again, if you submit AI-generated code, please double-check every line.
