Contributions
-------------

Contributions are welcome in the form of pull requests.

Once the implementation of a piece of functionality is considered to be bug
free and properly documented (both API docs and an example script),
it can be incorporated into the master branch.

To help developing ``hnn-core``, you will need a few adjustments to your
installation as shown below.

If your contributions will make use of parallel backends for using more than one core, please see the additional installation steps for `parallel_backends`_

Running tests
=============

To run the tests using ``pytest``, you need to have the git cloned ``hnn-core``
repository with an editable pip install::

    $ git clone https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core --depth 1
    $ cd hnn-core
    $ pip install -e .
    $ python setup.py build_mod

Then, install the following python packages::

    $ pip install flake8 pytest pytest-cov

If you update a mod file, you will have to rebuild them using the command::

    $ python setup.py build_mod

MPI tests are skipped if the ``mpi4py`` module is not installed. This allows testing features not related to parallelization without installing the extra dependencies as described in `parallel_backends`_.

Updating documentation
======================

Update ``doc/api.rst`` and ``doc/whats_new.rst`` as appropriate.

Building the documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The documentation can be built using sphinx. For that, please additionally
install the following::

    $ pip install matplotlib sphinx numpydoc sphinx-gallery sphinx_bootstrap_theme pillow mpi4py joblib psutil

If you are using a newer version of pip, you may be prompted to use the flag ``--use-feature=2020-resolver``. If this happens, please add it as recommended::

    $ pip install --use-feature=2020-resolver matplotlib sphinx numpydoc sphinx-gallery sphinx_bootstrap_theme pillow mpi4py joblib psutil

You can build the documentation locally using the command::

    $ cd doc/
    $ make html

While MNE is not needed to install hnn-core, as a developer you will need to install it
to run all the examples successfully. Please find
the installation instructions on the `MNE website <https://mne.tools/stable/install/mne_python.html>`_.

If you want to build the documentation locally without running all the examples,
use the command::

    $ make html-noplot

Continuous Integration
======================

The repository is tested via continuous integration with Travis and Circle. The automated
tests run on Travis while the documentation is built on Circle.
