================================================
04. From MEG sensor-space data to HNN simulation
================================================

This example demonstrates how to calculate an inverse solution of the median
nerve evoked response potential (ERP) in S1 from the MNE somatosensory dataset,
and then simulate a biophysical model network that reproduces the observed
dynamics. Note that we do not expound on how we came up with the sequence of
evoked drives used in this example, rather, we only demonstrate its
implementation. For those who want more background on the HNN model and the
process used to articulate the proximal and distal drives needed to simulate
evoked responses, see the `HNN ERP tutorial`_. The sequence of evoked drives
presented here is not part of a current publication but is motivated by prior
studies [1]_, [2]_.

First, we will import the packages needed for computing the inverse solution
from the MNE somatosensory dataset. `MNE`_ can be installed with
``pip install mne``, and the somatosensory dataset can be downloaded by
importing ``somato`` from ``mne.datasets``.

Now we set the the path of the ``somato`` dataset for subject ``'01'``.

There are several methods to do source reconstruction. Some of the methods
such as MNE are distributed source methods whereas dipole fitting will
estimate the location and amplitude of a single current dipole. At the
moment, we do not offer explicit recommendations on which source
reconstruction technique is best for HNN. However, we do want our users
to note that the dipole currents simulated with HNN are assumed to be normal
to the cortical surface. Hence, using the option ``pick_ori='normal'`` is
appropriate.

Visualizing the distributed S1 activation in reference to the geometric
structure of the cortex (i.e., plotted on a structural MRI) can help us
figure out how to orient the dipole. Note that in the HNN framework,
positive and negative deflections of a current dipole source correspond to
upwards (from deep to superficial) and downwards (from superficial to deep)
current flow, respectively. Uncomment the following code to open an
interactive 3D render of the brain and its surface activation (requires the
``pyvista`` python library). You should get 2 plots, the first showing the
post-central gyrus label from which the dipole time course was extracted and
the second showing MNE activation at 0.040 sec that resemble the following
images.

Now we extract the representative time course of dipole activation in our
labeled brain region using ``mode='pca_flip'`` (see `this MNE-python
example`_ for more details). Note that the most prominent component of the
median nerve response occurs in the posterior wall of the central sulcus at
~0.040 sec. Since the dipolar activity here is negative, we orient the
extracted waveform so that the deflection at ~0.040 sec is pointed downwards.
Thus, the ~0.040 sec deflection corresponds to current flow traveling from
superficial to deep layers of cortex.

To simulate the source of the median nerve evoked response, we add a
sequence of synchronous evoked drives: 1 proximal, 2 distal, and 1 final
proximal drive. In order to understand the physiological implications of
proximal and distal drive as well as the general process used to articulate
a sequence of exogenous drive for simulating evoked responses, see the
`HNN ERP tutorial`_. Note that setting ``n_drive_cells=1`` and
``cell_specific=False`` creates a drive with synchronous input across cells
in the network.

Since the model is a reduced representation of the larger network
contributing to the response, the model response is noisier than it would be
in the net activity from a larger network where these effects are averaged
out, and the dipole amplitude is smaller than the recorded data. The
post-processing steps of smoothing and scaling the simulated dipole response
allow us to more accurately approximate the true signal responsible for the
recorded macroscopic evoked response [1]_, [2]_.
